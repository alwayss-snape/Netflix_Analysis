# Analysis of Content present on Netflix and find Top 15 movies and Series.

There's a plethora of content present on Netflix, and sometime's one may think that Netflix focuses on quantity over quality in recent times.
So, as a person who watches a lot of video content, I thought to help myself out. I found a databse that powers Flixgem.com
(A website that has the hidden gems of Netflix).

So, I gathered up the data and listed down the following results that I needed:
1. Series or Movies? Which one has the highest quantity on Netflix?
2. What are the most popular genres in both Series and Movies on Netflix?
3. What are the hidden gems present? The gems that often people don't get a chance to watch.
4. What's the average duration of an episode of a Series and a Movie on Netflix? Because obviously we want the best content but not want to sit for hours.
5. What are the Top 15 most awarded Movies and Series present on Netflix? This is for people who want to watch the hyped up content.

I used Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib & Seaborn to analyze and get the answers of the above data. You can find the graphical visualization of data in the 
uploaded screenshots.
